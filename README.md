# PWM-Drawer

## The potentiometer reads the desired value throigh ADC, then is given to the timer to generate a PWM signal using Phase Correct PWM, and then displayed on the graphical LCD through I2C Protocol.

### The code consists of the i2c lcd display driver, an interface for ADC, timer, and main with the implementation file. In this repo also included is a demonstration video with the simulation proteus file. The hex file is found inside the Debug folder in the code.

### Here is the code flowcart:
